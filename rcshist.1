.SH NAME
rcshist \-
display RCS change history
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB\*(Nm \fI[\fB-mR\fI] [\fB-r\fI branch|\fBMAIN\fI|\fBALL\fI] file ...\fP
.br
\fB\*(Nm -L \fIrevision\fR \fIrcsfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(Nm utility displays the complete revision history of a set of RCS files
including log messages and patches.
The output is sorted in reverse date order over all revisions of all files.
.PP
The second form displays the patch associated with a particular
revision of an RCS file.
In this case, the revision must be specified numerically and
.I rcsfile
must be an RCS
.B ,v
file.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.IP \fB\-m\fR
Reduce memory usage by retaining only a small fraction of revisions in
memory.
Normally,
\*(Nm
will cache all revisions of all files, since this reduces computation
time significantly.
For very large file sets, this behavior can cause excessive memory usage.
.IP \fB\-R\fR
Recursively search all paths specified for files to analyze.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR \fIbranch|MAIN|ALL\fR"
Restrict output to revisions on the specified symbolic branch tag.
Two special branch names are supported:
.RS
.IP MAIN
Only revisions on the main trunk branch are displayed.
.IP ALL
All revisions are displayed regardless of their branch.
This is the default if \*(Nm cannot infer a branch tag from a CVS/Tag file.
.RE
.PP
Each
.I file
listed on the command line specifies an RCS file to be examined.
The filename is interpreted as follows:
.PP
If the file has a
.B ,v
suffix,
\*(Nm considers it as an RCS format file and opens it directly.
.PP
If the file has no
.B ,v
suffix,
\*(Nm searches for a CVS directory in the same directory as the file.
If this exists,
\*(Nm
attempts to find the RCS file based on the contents of the
CVS/Root and CVS/Repository files.
If a CVS/Tag file exists, and if no branch tag has been specified
on the command-line or inferred from elsewhere, then
\*(Nm
uses the branch tag from CVS/Tag as the default branch to
display.
.PP
Finally, if the file has no
.B ,v
suffix and no CVS directory was found,
\*(Nm
searches for an RCS directory in the same directory as the file.
If this exists,
\*(Nm
will look for an RCS
.B ,v
file corresponding to the specified file.
.PP
If \*(Nm fails to locate an RCS file
corresponding to a specified command-line filename,
\*(Nm
will simply print a warning message and continue.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP RCS_DIR
if defined, specifies the directory in which RCS archive files are found.
Normally files are found in "./RCS".
